Harry Potter Quiz for my Grow with Google challenge through Udacity's Android Basic Nanodegree.

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of my choice.

What I learned during this project:

Planning my app design before coding.
Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
Creating, positioning, and styling views.
Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
Commenting and documenting your code.
